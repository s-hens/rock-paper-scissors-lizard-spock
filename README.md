Summary: This is a JavaScript-based web game where the user plays "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock" against the computer. The computer chooses its moves randomly.

Done as part of The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/) foundations curriculum. 

Creating this game, I learned about:
- JavaScript functions, conditionals, loops, and events
- DOM manipulation
